My CodeForces solutions that I did in my first year of college. (Saving for Future Reference)

Keep in mind that these were done in my first year when I had very little experience with coding, some of these solutions may not be the most efficient. :))))). 
These are just here to guide, provide insight, as well as for me to take pride in how far I've come as a programer :))))
